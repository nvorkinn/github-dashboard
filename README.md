# GitHub dashboard

A live dashboard of Nikolai's GitHub projects: pull requests, checks and release workflows, updated by push from GitHub's
webhooks. The browser talks to api.github.com itself; a small relay only signs in to the GitHub App, refreshes its token
and passes webhook events on to the open page.

It replaces the dashboard inside countdown-server once it does everything that one does.
